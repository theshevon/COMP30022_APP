# COMP30022 Capstone Project

## Description

The problem being addressed is that almost every family has items they may want to pass down the generations. Photographs, letters, previous items such as art or jewellery, items of cultural significance are examples.

The intention of this web application is to allow an individual to effectively catalog family artefacts that they may want to pass down the generations over the years in different countries.

## Usage

After you clone the repository, run `npm i` to install all the dependencies.
Currently only the backend functionality has been configured (ie. express +
firebase). Basic functionality testing can be done by running `firebase deploy`
and then verifying the the response using Postman.
