# COMP30022 Capstone Project

### Description
The problem being addressed is that almost every family has items they may want to pass down the generations. Photographs, letters, previous items such as art or jewellery, items of cultural significance are examples.
The intention of this web application is to allow an individual to effectively catalog family artefacts that they may want to pass down the generations over the years in different countries.

### Usage

After you clone the repository, run `npm i` to install all the dependencies.
Next run `node server.js` or if you have it installed, `nodemon` to fire up
the express.js server. The express server will be mounted on port 5000 while the
react application will be mounted on port 3000.
